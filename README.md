## 🔥 Command Line Interface (CLI)

MCPM provides a comprehensive CLI with a clean, organized interface. The v2.0 architecture uses a global configuration model where servers are installed once and can be organized with profiles, then integrated into specific MCP clients as needed.

### ℹ️ General

```bash
mcpm --help          # Display help information and available commands
mcpm --version       # Display the current version of MCPM
```

### 🌐 Server Management

Global server installation and management commands:

```bash
# 🔍 Search and Install
mcpm search [QUERY]           # Search the MCP Registry for available servers
mcpm info SERVER_NAME         # Display detailed information about a server
mcpm install SERVER_NAME      # Install a server from registry to global configuration
mcpm uninstall SERVER_NAME    # Remove a server from global configuration

# 📋 List and Inspect
mcpm ls                       # List all installed servers and their profile assignments
mcpm edit SERVER_NAME         # Edit a server configuration
mcpm inspect SERVER_NAME      # Launch MCP Inspector to test/debug a server
```

### 🚀 Server Execution

Execute servers directly for testing or integration:

```bash
mcpm run SERVER_NAME          # Execute a server directly over stdio
mcpm run SERVER_NAME --http   # Execute a server over HTTP for testing
mcpm share SERVER_NAME        # Share a server through secure tunnel for remote access
mcpm usage                    # Display comprehensive analytics and usage data
```

### 📂 Profile Management

Profiles are virtual tags that organize servers into logical groups for different workflows:

```bash
# 🔄 Profile Operations
mcpm profile ls               # List all profiles and their tagged servers
mcpm profile create PROFILE   # Create a new profile
mcpm profile rm PROFILE       # Remove a profile (servers remain installed)
mcpm profile edit PROFILE     # Interactive server selection for profile

# 🚀 Profile Execution
mcpm profile run PROFILE      # Execute all servers in a profile over stdio or HTTP
mcpm profile share PROFILE    # Share all servers in a profile through secure tunnel
mcpm profile inspect PROFILE  # Launch MCP Inspector for all servers in profile
```

### 🖥️ Client Integration

Manage MCP client configurations (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):

```bash
mcpm client ls                 # List all supported MCP clients and their status
mcpm client edit CLIENT_NAME   # Interactive server enable/disable for a client
mcpm client edit CLIENT_NAME -e # Open client config in external editor
mcpm client import CLIENT_NAME  # Import server configurations from a client
```

### 🔄 Server Updates

Check for and apply updates to installed MCP servers:

```bash
mcpm update                   # Update all servers
mcpm update SERVER_NAME       # Update a specific server
mcpm update --check           # Dry run — check for updates without applying
mcpm update --rebase          # Use git rebase instead of fast-forward
mcpm update --init            # Scan servers and populate source metadata
mcpm update --init --force    # Re-detect all source metadata
```

MCPM tracks where each server came from (git repo, npm package, HTTP remote) and can pull the latest changes automatically. Git-based servers are updated via `git pull --ff-only` by default, with `--rebase` as an opt-in alternative. NPX/UVX servers auto-update at runtime and are shown for informational purposes.

### 🛠️ System & Configuration

```bash
mcpm doctor                   # Check system health and server status
mcpm config                   # Manage MCPM configuration and settings
mcpm migrate                  # Migrate from v1 to v2 configuration
```

### 📚 Registry

The MCP Registry is a central repository of available MCP servers that can be installed using MCPM. The registry is available at [mcpm.sh/registry](https://mcpm.sh/registry).

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration

MCPM is designed to be AI agent friendly with comprehensive automation support. Every interactive command has a non-interactive alternative using CLI parameters and environment variables.

### 🔧 Non-Interactive Mode

Set environment variables to enable full automation:

```bash
export MCPM_NON_INTERACTIVE=true  # Disable all interactive prompts
export MCPM_FORCE=true            # Skip confirmations
export MCPM_JSON_OUTPUT=true      # JSON output for parsing
```

### 📋 LLM.txt Guide

The [llm.txt](llm.txt) file provides comprehensive documentation specifically designed for AI agents, including:

- Complete command reference with parameters and examples
- Environment variable usage patterns
- Best practices for automation
- Error handling and troubleshooting
- Batch operation patterns

The llm.txt file is automatically generated from the CLI structure and kept up-to-date with each release.

### ⚡ Example Usage

#### Use case 1: expose a local stdio server over HTTP

1) Add the server to MCPM
```bash
mcpm new [MY_SERVER_NAME] --type stdio --command "[COMMAND]" --args "[ARG_1] [ARG_2] ..."
```
(Add `--force` arg to bypass the confirmation interaction)
Verify it appears in your installed servers:
```bash
mcpm ls
```
You should see `[MY_SERVER_NAME]` in the list.

2) Serve it over HTTP
```bash
mcpm run [MY_SERVER_NAME] --http
```
MCPM prints the server URL, for example:
```
URL: http://127.0.0.1:6276/mcp/
```

3) Expose it on your network (optional)
```bash
mcpm run [MY_SERVER_NAME] --http --host 0.0.0.0
```
Tip: add `--port <PORT>` to choose a different port.


#### Use case 2: combine multiple servers and serve them as one profile

1) Add the servers to MCPM
```bash
# Stdio server
mcpm new [SERVER_A] --type stdio --command "[COMMAND]" --args "[ARG_1] [ARG_2] ..." --force

# Remote HTTP/SSE server
mcpm new [SERVER_B] --type remote --url "http://SERVER_ADDR/mcp/" --force
```

2) Create a profile and add the servers
Interactive:
```bash
mcpm profile create [PROFILE_NAME]
mcpm profile edit [PROFILE_NAME]
```
MCPM would list out all installed servers, you can use arrows to navigate, space to select/deselect, type to search, and Enter to confirm.

Verify:
```bash
mcpm profile ls
```
You should see your profile with the selected servers.

3) Run the profile
```bash
# Stdio
mcpm profile run [PROFILE_NAME]

# HTTP
mcpm profile run [PROFILE_NAME] --http

# Optional: host and port
mcpm profile run [PROFILE_NAME] --http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```


#### Other common usage
```bash
# Server management
mcpm new myserver --type stdio --command "python -m server" --force
mcpm edit myserver --env "API_KEY=secret" --force

# Profile management  
mcpm profile edit web-dev --add-server myserver --force
mcpm profile run web-dev --port 8080

# Client integration
mcpm client edit cursor --add-profile web-dev --force
```

   mcpm --help

   # Or use the development script
   ./test_cli.py --help
   ```

5. Run tests
   ```
   pytest tests/
   ```

### ✅ Best Practices

- 📁 Use the src-based directory structure to prevent import confusion
- 🔧 Develop with an editable install using `uv pip install -e .`
- 🧩 Keep commands modular in the `src/mcpm/commands/` directory
- 🧪 Add tests for new functionality in the `tests/` directory
- 💻 Use the `test_cli.py` script for quick development testing


### 🔢 Version Management

MCP uses a single source of truth pattern for version management to ensure consistency across all components.

#### 🏷️ Version Structure

- 📍 The canonical version is defined in `version.py` at the project root
- 📥 `src/mcpm/__init__.py` imports this version
- 📄 `pyproject.toml` uses dynamic versioning to read from `version.py`
- 🏷️ Git tags are created with the same version number prefixed with 'v' (e.g., v1.0.0)

#### 🔄 Updating the Version

When releasing a new version:

1. Use the provided version bump script
   ```
   ./bump_version.sh NEW_VERSION
   # Example: ./bump_version.sh 1.1.0
   ```

2. Push the changes and tags
   ```
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

3. Create a GitHub release matching the new version

This process ensures that the version is consistent in all places: code, package metadata, and git tags.
PyPI release is handled by the CI/CD pipeline and will be triggered automatically.
